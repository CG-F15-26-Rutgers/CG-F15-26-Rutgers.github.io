                This testcase is modeled after the classic arcade game Pacman. This design turned out to be too complex for our AI to properly handle.
				For example, if the agents spawn in the center of the map (where ghosts traditionally spawn in the real game) and are told to navigate
				outside of the maze, they will attempt to walk through the walls. It is unclear why this happens. A similar problem occurs on the
				office testcase, but only for a small number of agents. Most of the agents find their way through the office.

				<br>
				<br>
				Due to this problem, we have two groups of agents spawn in the upper corners of the maze and find their way to the center. The
				agents don't seem to have any problem finding this goal. Since this left the bottom portion of the map unused, we have two other
				groups of agents spawn in the lower corners and attempt to switch places. To differentiate this from other testcases, we used a large
				number of very small agents. The end result looks like a low-energy particle collider. The large number of agents occupying a single
				cell means that the steerbench program does not work on this testcase.
