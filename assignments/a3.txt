Following the slides provided, we were able to write code for the social forces AI. The code built and compiled however, when attempting to run steersim, the terminal would output:

ERROR: exception caught in main:
Could not find the module named "sfAI".
  tried user-specified search path: ./sfAI.dll
  tried engine's search path: ./sfAI.dll
  tried the current directory: sfAI.dll

We thought this problem might have arisen due to not building or compiling correctly, so we debugged extensively but we couldn't find the problem.

We also noticed in the build log there was one file that was skipped, maybe that could have led to the erroneous output.
